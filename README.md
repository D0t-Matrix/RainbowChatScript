# RainbowChatScript

> Abandoned as of now. Will be picked up as a replatform to function as an addon to [FrankerFaceZ](https://github.com/FrankerFaceZ)

# Project Goal:
web script to input a command to change the username color to a random hex color value each time the user sends a message.



# Working as of:
4/1/16 - 1/1/17
2/1/17 - 10/10/17

# Broken as of:
1/1/17 - 2/1/17
10/10/17 - current

currently broken as most recent redesign of twitch page rebuilt how the web elements are created and interacted with. 
Twitch has moved from emberJS to reactJS as their codebase, resulting in needed work to redesign how script works.
